    install.sh [options] [mode] [command...]

    NOTE: You must have root access to use this script.

Description
    This script walks through the installation of the products on this ISO.

    With required conditions met and no options or arguments specified, this 
    script will install QAS including group policy, prompting for information
    as needed. This is referred to as "simple mode for QAS".

    As an extension to simple mode you can pass the command line arguments 
    listed at the end of this help page. These arguments correspond to the 
    packages available on the ISO by which you can install a new product, as 
    well as upgrade or remove any existing ones. Minimal, but essential 
    information and interaction will ensue as needed.

    Two additional usage modes including interactive and unattended are 
    available for greater control over installation and, especially, for 
    scripting.

Global options
    The following options apply to all modes:

    -d                Turn on debug
    -h                Displays basic command line help
    --help            Displays full script help
    -v,--version      Displays version and list products available on this ISO
    -l path           Specify path to One Identity license file to copy 
                        Not valid with -i (Interactive mode).
    -p                Specify alternate ISO path to search for install packages.
    -t                Test host and iso and report on what is installed and 
                        available.

    The debug level is useful in cooperation with the support personnel at 
    One Identity LLC. It dumps a great deal of information to the console as well 
    as creating a trace file on /tmp. A One Identity support person might ask for these
    files which reveal only general information about your host platform 
    (hostname, operating system and architecture, version, etc.).

Modes:
    <none>            Simple mode
    -i                Interactive mode
    -q                Unattended mode

Commands:
    Both simple and unattended modes will accept command arguments. Commands are 
    formed using the product names. Use the '<product_name>' to install or 
    upgrade and 'no<product_name>' to uninstall. You may also specify various 
    special commands listed below. NOTE: Commands will be executed in specified
    order. For a list of available products run 'install.sh -v'.

    Special Commands:
        upgrade         Upgrades all products on the system
        remove          Removes all products from the system
        join            Executes interactive vasjoin.sh script. Not valid 
                            with -q (Unattended mode).
        preflight       Executes interactive preflight test. Not valid 
                            with -q (Unattended mode).
        license         Executes interactive install of license files (or use 
                            -l option). Not valid in with -q (Unattended mode).

    Example:
        # Upgrade vasclnt, uninstall vasgp, and install vasproxyd
        install.sh vasclnt novasgp vasproxyd

        # Upgrade all products
        install.sh -q upgrade

        # Remove all products and install vasclnt and vasgp
        install.sh remove vasclnt vasgp

Simple Mode
    This mode is invoked by default. It will simply install vasclnt and vasgp 
    and and then provide the option to join to the domain and license the 
    product. This is useful for quickly setting up the machine for testing. You 
    can specify an alternate set of commands to run at the command line.

    Example:
        # Install vasclnt and vasgp
        install.sh

        # Upgrade vasclnt and vasgp and uninstall vasyp
        install.sh vasclnt vasgp novasyp

Interactive Mode
    Interactive mode creates a list of products available for installation. It is
    engaged by invoking install.sh with the -i option. Any additional command-
    line arguments passed are ignored.

    The menu presented in this mode will include the options of installing,
    upgrading or removing packages accordingly as they exist or do not exist 
    on your host platform.

    Example:
        # Install products from menu
        install.sh -i

Unattended Mode
    This mode was created specifically for scripting. No interaction or
    confirmation of any kind is conducted that would halt a script in its
    progress. The EULA will automatically be accepted. Some informative 
    output will reach the console, however.

    NOTE: The 'join', 'preflight', and 'license' commands are available but do 
          not have a non-interactive mode.

    Examples
        # Install or upgrade the QAS client in unattended mode:
        install.sh -q vasclnt

        # Uninstall the QAS client in unattended mode:
        install.sh -q novasclnt

        # Upgrade the QAS client in simple mode while uninstalling the QAS SDK:
        install.sh vasclnt novasdev

        # Install the QAS and group policy clients along with your One Identity license
        # in simple mode:
        install.sh -l /tmp/license1.txt vasclnt vasgp
